## üß∞ Developer Info

### üìù Checklist of required changes

The following is list of actions that must be performed before using this template. Most of the changes concern changing the name `Arcadia` to the name of the new application.

As the template is instantiated from github, the new name will automatically replace the top level directory name, that being ___arcadia___.

+ `github actions workflow`: If the client application needs to use github actions for continuous integration, then the name of the [workflow](.github/workflows/ci-workflow.yml) needs to be changed. If not, then the workflow file should be deleted
+ `code coverage publication`: by default, coverage is published to [coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io), so coveralls needs to be setup to prevent the github actions workflow from failing. Alternatively, another service can be used. The user needs to adjust the __Send coverage__ job in the workflow accordingly. 
+ `replace README content`
+ `rename lib folder` to something domain specific
+ `create .env file`: Add any appropriate secrets to a newly created .env in the root directory
+ `update message id`: This package supports i18n and as part of that defines messages that need to be translated. The user needs to update the message ids of defined messages in `messages.go`, which by default contain ___arcadia-lib___ as part of the id.
